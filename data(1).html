            <td class="column8 style0 s">Fraud evidence needed to consider vacating.... Pending application, LL raised the small apartment/occupancy reasoning, but judge said he couldn't do that while application was still pending: &quot;The exception relied upon by the petitioner is available only after a tender of ERAP funds. A landlord of a one to four family dwelling who intends to occupy the unit at issue (either personally or by an immediate family member) is not required to allow the tenants the additional 12 months occupancy but can seek to evict immediately upon payment of the ERAP benefits. There is nothing in the statute that authorizes the Court to disregard the automatic stay of eviction triggered by a pending ERAP application and grant a judgment of possession and warrant of eviction before a final determination of eligibility for ERAP funds.&quot; Also claimed this: &quot;Again, as noted, the landlord who refuses the tendered ERAP funds may seek immediate eviction based upon the pending petition without any intention to occupy the premises as their primary residence.&quot; TLDR: &quot;This Court does not possess the jurisdiction to make this determination absent clear and convincing evidence of fraud.

For the following reasons this Court concludes that it does have such authority and that it is appropriate to do so in this case.&quot; ... &quot;After reviewing the statute and legislative intent, this Court concludes that it does have the authority to lift an ERAP stay in an appropriate case and it is not necessary to reach Petitioner's constitutional claim. As to certain matters, the ERAP Law assigns exclusive authority to OTDA: To establish eligibility standards, set priorities and process ERAP applications. However, the &quot;Restrictions on eviction&quot; section - including the stay provision - adheres to matters outside OTDA's realm; that is, to eviction proceedings pending in the court system with which the administrative agency is not involved. And while the stay language appears absolute, to find it to be so would raise doubts as to the statute's constitutionality, an outcome to be avoided where possible.&quot; &quot;However, the ERAP Law also does not include any provisions preventing landlords from challenging such a stay in a pending court proceeding and raising whatever cogent legal arguments they may have, including that ERAP funds may be irrelevant to a particular case, or that occupants of a particular residence clearly do not meet one or more of the program's fundamental eligibility criteria. If this Court were to categorically refuse to consider such arguments the same concerns that were implicated in Chrysafis v Marks would arise.&quot; </td>

Declines to follow other lower courts' holdings that housing court has power to determine ERAP eligibility. Distinguishes constitutional issue from Chrysafis, finding that it is OTDA, not the court, that has authority to determine the merits of the ERAP stay. Landlord's proper remedy is an Article 78 against OTDA. Court also notes that landlord is seeking arrears and, if stay is lifted, landlord could obtain a money judgment before ERAP provisionally approved - which is a defense to such a judgment.
